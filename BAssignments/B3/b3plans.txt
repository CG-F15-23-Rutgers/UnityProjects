Goal: We must create an interactive, non-linear, immersive narrative experience. Think "game". 
This game can have any structure and story we want. 
Many of the requirements have been created in previous assignments. 
We can approach this by using B2 as our template, and extending it with previous projects, 
as well as new implementations as required. 
However, we can now afford to be more creative with how B2's story is handled. 
We can add new characters, a camera, a more complex scene, etc.
