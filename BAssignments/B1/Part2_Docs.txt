The player's animation state is controlled using Unity's mecanim animation system. So far, we have defined 5 parameters: Speed, Direction, Jump, ColliderHeight, and Run. These are controlled through scripting. Whenever the player's speed goes above or below zero, he walks forward or backward respectively. The left and right buttons (whatever the horizontal axis is set to) defines the Direction parameter.  -1 is left, 0 is neutral, and 1 is right. Pressing and holding the shift key causes the Run parameter to be set to 1 -- normally it is at 0 for default walking. The jump is a bit more complicated; it is an extra credit attempt in that it isn't just a simple jump. We defined a boolean for the Jump parameter, which is set to true when the space button is hit. If the player is moving and Jump is set to true, he will jump. Then, through scripting we control the animation transition. A ray is cast to check the players height, and the animation is matched to this rise and fall. However, the collider is also adjusted so that the player can actually jump over small objects (he doesn't jump very high, for realism) using the ColliderHeight parameter. This is all in the PlayerController script.

The camera is a simple LERP camera defined in the ThirdPersonCamera script, which follows an object attached to the player object in a smooth manner from behind and above.
